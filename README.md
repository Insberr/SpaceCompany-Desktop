# SpaceCompany Desktop
Im making a desktop version of a game called <a href="https://github.com/sparticle999/spacecompany">Space Company</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/sparticle999">Sparticle999</a> on github

## Overview:
Space Company is a science-fiction incremental game where you start from humble beginnings on Earth, working your way up to travelling between star systems and building Dyson Spheres and pretty much colonising the entire galaxy(ies?)


## Plans
* Redesign the ui (still using bootstrap) to make it feel more like a desktop program.
* Waiting for version 1 of <a href="https://github.com/sparticle999/spacecompany">Space Company</a> to be released befor I do too much work on this project

### How To Install The Game
As of now, you can run the raw code using `npm start` in the code directory

I have only made a linux build of the game, the installer can be found <a href="">here</a>

I will make windows and MacOS build soon, dont worry. But if you really need to play it on your platform (what I did at least), 
Open up the terminal and `cd` into the game code directory.
Then run: 
```mpm run make```
This should build the code for your OS. Once that is done, open up the `out` directory that was made

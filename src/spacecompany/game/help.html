										Beginner's Guide
									</h2>

										This guide will get you from starting the game to activating your first wonder and will be helpful to grasp everything you need to do. You can refer to this guide at anytime while playing by clicking the Help/FAQ tab in the top right and selecting the Getting Started sub-tab.

										First Steps
									</h3>
									<span>
										The first thing you can do is start gathering resources. To do this, click the Resources tab near the top left of the screen. This will bring you to the resources display. You can click any of the resources to access its interface, where you can mine the resource yourself by clicking, or you can hire people or build machines to gain those resources for you. While you can hire workers for all three resources, it is recommended to prioritise Metal and Wood in the early stages of the game.

									<h3 class="default btn-link">
										Research
									</h3>
									<span>
										To unlock research, you must purchase a metal miner, costing 10 Metal and 5 Wood. This is the first step to idle automation. The Research tab is where you can build laboratories to produce science for you, and also where you can discover and research new technologies to further help you through the game.
										<br>
										<br>
										The first technology you can research is 'Storage Upgrades', which allows you to build storages to hold more of each type of resource. This is necessary when building machines and other tools costs more than 50 of a resource.

										You can also research 'Basic Energy Production', which opens up the world of power and advanced machines to help you get resources even faster.

										Balancing Resources &amp; Energy
									</h3>
									<span>
										This game has different amounts output by each machine. This can make balancing your resources hard, especially your Energy, Charcoal and Wood as they are consumed by other machines. As at tip, prioritise which resources you should build machines for first - in most cases Metal - and produce the 2 Energy required for a heavy drill. Don't upgrade everything to machines at once as you will end up with an Energy deficit (this is bad as the machines won't work without Energy). Build up your Charcoal to build engines or increase the number of solar panels to counter this.

										Solar System
									</h3>
									<span>
										Well, it isn't called Space Company for nothing. The first thing needed to unlock inter-planetary exploration is to build a rocket. This is the first large goal that you should aim for as a target. To build a rocket, you need a lot of resources, which you most likely need to use advanced machines to get without taking an extremely long time. Secondly, to launch it requires 20 rocket fuel, which can be made in chemical plants. These require a large amount of Oil and Charcoal to produce - 20 of each per second per plant. Once you have 20 Rocket Fuel and have built a rocket, press the launch button to unlock exploration around the solar system and new technologies and ways to get resources.

										When will the game be updated next?
									</h4>
									<span>
										Well, this isn't a full-time project for me. This means that although I will try to work on it as much as I can, progress can be slow. However, I will endeavour to release updates as often as I can and fix any bugs as quickly as possible.

										Does donating give me anything?

										No. I didn't want to make this game pay-to-win and make people feel that they had to pay money to get further in the game because this makes it less appealing to those who don't want to donate.
